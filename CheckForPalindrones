/* Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note
You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case 
in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2". /*


function palindrome(str) {
  /* This took some regex lookup and music. I stored each step into its own variable to test that it was working...
  but I'm positive there's a more efficient way to get this done. */
  
  var settingString = str.replace(/[^a-z0-9+]+/gi, '');  // I wanted to get rid of all irrelevant characters from the string first.
  var ignoredCase = settingString.toLowerCase();  // Normalize first!
  var preFlipArray = ignoredCase.split('');  // Now it's normalized, so I can get it into an array for comparison.
  var flipArray = preFlipArray.reverse(); // Reversed letters. Still an array.
  var flipString = flipArray.join('');  // Not anymore! String again.
  if (ignoredCase==flipString){
    return true;
  }
  else return false;  // Do I really need this? on Free Code Camp, I did.
}



palindrome("cat&dogz"); //FALSE!
palindrome("eye"); //TRUE!
